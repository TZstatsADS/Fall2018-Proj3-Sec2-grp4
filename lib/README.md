# Project: Can you unscramble a blurry image? 

In this project, we will carry out model evaluation and selection for predictive analytics on image data. As data scientists, we often need to evaluate different modeling/analysis strategies and decide what is the best. Such decisions need to be supported by sound evidence in the form of model assessment, validation and comparison. In addition, we also need to communicate our decision and supporting evidence clearly and convincingly in an accessible fashion.
Challenge
For this project, you will receive a set of 1500 pairs of images. For each pair, you have a high-resolution image that serves as the ground truth and a down-sampled low-resolution image as the input for the learning task. The learning goal is to produce a predicted high resolution image as output based on the low-resolution input that is as close to the ground truth as possible.

Your client is interested in creating an mobile AI program that can enhance the resolution of blurry and low-resolution images.

The portability of this AI program (holding storage and memory cost) and the computational efficiency (test running time cost) are of great concern to your client. This translates to a balance between the complexity of variables/features/models used and the predictive performance.


Task
Assume that the current practice on your client side is just using boosted decision stumps on neighboring pixels (see Tutorial for more detail). R pakcage gbm can be used to implement this classifier.

Your task for this project is to 1) implement the current practice as the baseline model on your system, 2) implement an improvement to the current practice, and 3) evaluate the performance gain of your proposed improvement against the baseline. You should produce an evaluation report using a R notebook (as a file main.rmd in the doc folder).

Main.rmd-  organizes **all computational steps** for evaluating the proposed image classification framework.
